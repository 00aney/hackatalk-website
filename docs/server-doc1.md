Our server is hosted on [azure websites](https://hackatalk.azurewebsites.net) and we are mainly using graphql. You can checkout our graphql resolver in [playground](https://hackatalk.azurewebsites.net/graphql). Our development server is opened for everyone who wants to understand how `HackaTalk` works.

We are using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) and [nexus](https://nexus.js.org/docs/nexus-prisma) to serve our resolvers.
